I came, I saw, I conquered.

Experience is the teacher of all things.

It is easier to find men who will volunteer to die, than to find those who are willing to endure pain with patience.
Men are nearly always willing to believe what they wish.

Cowards die many times before their actual deaths.

Experience is the teacher of all things.
-Julius Caesar
